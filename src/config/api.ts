/**
 * API base URL, context-aware because the backend is reached differently on

 *
 *  - Browser: requests go directly to the public Express origin so multipart
 *    uploads are not constrained by a Next/Vercel proxy body limit.
 *  - Server (SSR/ISR): `fetch` needs an absolute origin — `BACKEND_API_URL`
 *    (falls back to the local dev backend).
